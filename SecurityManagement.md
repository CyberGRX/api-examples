CyberGRX will manage for both the API and Platform UI:
  - Authenticate client sessions
  - Authorize client transactions
  - Protect and validate access to tenant data according to assigned user roles
Users of the platform and API are responsible for:
  - Managing access to their tenant (company accounts)
  - Managing roles for their users
  - Managing key access and renewal policies (for both passwords and tokens)
